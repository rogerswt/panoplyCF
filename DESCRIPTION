Title: Cell-based Analysis Using t-SNE on Cytometric Fingerprints
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Wade Rogers
Maintainer: Wade Rogers <wade.rogers@spcytomics.com>
Description: PanoplyCF combines the speed and efficiency of Cytometric
    Fingerprinting (implemented in flowFP) with t-SNE dimensionality reduction.
    Conventional t-SNE imbedding cannot be applied prospectively to new
    data.  That is, the transformation cannot be stored and retrieved for future
    use. PanoplyCF solves this problem by doing the imbedding on CF bin centroids
    rather than individual events.  Thus, new data can be projected onto a given
    set of bins, represented in a flowFPModel, and thus transported into a
    pre-existing t-SNE map.
